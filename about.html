            <text>My name is Crystal and here are some facts about me. I was born in America, but my parents are from Taiwan. I took art, choir, horseback riding, and ballet classes for years. Lastly, I am a part of the Rowland Colorguard. We've won several High Auxilary awards and even won championships for the first time in Rowland history during my sophomore year</text>
